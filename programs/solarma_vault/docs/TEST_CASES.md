## Coverage Legend

| Status | Meaning |

| ✅ | Already implemented |
| 🆕 | To be implemented (Phase B) |

## 1. Scenario Tests (end-to-end lifecycle flows)

### S-1: Happy Wake — create → ack → claim ✅
> User creates alarm with deposit → alarm fires → user acknowledges → user claims back.
- Verify: Claimed status, owner balance restored, vault closed.
- Exists: `"Full lifecycle: create → snooze → ack_awake → claim"` (line 1219)

### S-2: Oversleep Slash — create → deadline → slash 🆕
> User creates alarm → doesn't wake up → third party slashes after deadline.
- Pre: create with Burn route, deposit = 0.1 SOL
- Wait: past deadline
- Action: third-party calls slash
- Assert: Slashed status, penalty_recipient received vault lamports, owner lost deposit

### S-3: Snooze Chain — create → snooze ×3 → ack → claim 🆕
> User creates alarm → snoozes 3 times → wakes up → claims remaining.
- Assert: remaining = initial − Σ(snooze_costs), each cost doubles
- Assert: alarm_time advanced by 3 × 300s = 900s
- Assert: deadline advanced by 900s
- Assert: snooze_count = 3

### S-4: Emergency Bail — create → emergency_refund 🆕
> User creates alarm → changes mind → emergency refund before alarm_time.
- Assert: Claimed status, owner received 95% of deposit + rent
- Assert: BURN_SINK received 5% penalty
- Assert: vault account closed

### S-5: Missed Ack → Slash — create → ack → deadline → slash 🆕
> User acknowledges but doesn't claim in time → gets slashed.
- Assert: Acknowledged → Slashed transition valid
- Verify: slash from Acknowledged state works (partially exists at line 2216)

### S-6: Snooze to Drain — create → snooze until vault drained → claim 🆕
> User snoozes repeatedly until remaining ≈ 0 → claims what's left.
- Key test: rent-exempt guard protects vault from GC
- Assert: eventually InsufficientDeposit stops snoozing
- Assert: claim still returns rent-exempt balance

## 3. Model-Based / State-Machine Test Plan 🆕

### M-1: Random Action Sequence with Invariant Checking

**Goal:** Generate random sequences of valid + invalid instructions, execute against a local validator, and verify all invariants hold.

**Design:**
```
for trial in 1..50:
    create_alarm(random deposit, random penalty_route)
    for step in 1..20:
        action = random_choice([ack, claim, snooze, slash, refund, wait])
        try execute(action)
        check_invariants(alarm_account):
            I-BAL-1: remaining ≤ initial
            I-BAL-2: vault.lamports ≥ rent_exempt_minimum
            I-STATE-1: if terminal → no more state changes
            I-STATE-2: snooze_count ≤ 10
            I-TIME-1: alarm_time < deadline
```

**Implementation approach:**
- TypeScript test with randomized action selection
- Seed-based RNG for reproducibility (`Math.seedrandom`)
- After each action: fetch alarm account, assert invariants
- Log full trace on failure for debugging

## 4. Property-Based Tests 🆕

### P-1: Snooze Cost Reference Model (Rust)
```rust
/// For any (remaining, snooze_count) where remaining > 0 and count < 10:
///   on_chain_cost == reference_cost
///   reference_cost = min(remaining, remaining * 10 / 100 * 2^count)
fn prop_snooze_cost_matches_reference(remaining: u64, count: u8)
```

### P-2: Emergency Penalty Reference Model (Rust)
```rust
/// For any remaining amount:
///   penalty = remaining * 5 / 100
///   returned = remaining - penalty
///   returned + penalty == remaining (no loss)
fn prop_emergency_penalty_conservation(remaining: u64)
```

### P-3: Balance Conservation (TypeScript — on-chain)
```typescript
/// After every snooze:
///   old_remaining - new_remaining == lamports_sent_to_sink
/// After claim:
///   owner_balance_delta ≈ vault_lamports_before (within tx fee)
/// After slash:
///   penalty_recipient_delta ≈ vault_lamports_before
```

## 5. Summary — Tests to Implement in Phase B

| **Property** | 3 | P-1, P-2, P-3 |
