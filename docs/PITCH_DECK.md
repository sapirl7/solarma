# Solarma — Pitch Deck Content

## Slide 1: Title
**Solarma**  
*Wake up and prove it. Your SOL depends on it.*

🌅 The first Solana-native alarm app with financial commitment

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**68% of Americans hit snooze at least once per day**

- Snooze addiction costs $12B annually in lost productivity
- Traditional alarms have zero consequences
- Willpower alone doesn't work

*"I set 5 alarms every morning and still oversleep"*

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Solarma combines physical challenges with crypto stakes**

1. 🎯 **Set Alarm** — Choose wake time + deposit amount
2. 🏃 **Wake Proof** — Walk 20 steps to dismiss
3. 💰 **Claim Back** — Complete challenge = get your SOL back
4. 🔥 **Fail** — Miss deadline = deposit burned/donated/sent to friend

---

## Slide 4: How It Works
