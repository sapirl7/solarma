# ── Parser crash workaround ──
# ktlint standard:argument-list-wrapping crashes on multiline lambdas
# passed as named Compose parameters. Known upstream issue.
# TODO: re-enable once ktlint ships a fix (check with ktlint 1.6+)

# ── Compose conventions ──
# Compose @Composable functions use PascalCase by convention.
# ktlint's standard:function-naming expects camelCase, which
# conflicts with the entire Compose ecosystem.

# Compose heavily uses wildcard imports for layout/material3/runtime.
# Expanding them adds 20+ explicit imports per screen with no
# readability benefit.
