# Solarma — Active Context

## Current Focus
Phase 1 bootstrap complete. Repository ready for GitHub push and Phase 2 planning.

## Next Steps
1. Push to GitHub (`git remote add origin git@github.com:sapirl7/solarma.git && git push -u origin main`)
2. Plan Phase 2: Vault Contract MVP (full deposit/claim implementation)

## Recent Completions (2026-01-28)
- Created full repository structure with 60+ files
- Memory Bank: 7 core documents
- Agent roles: 6 role definitions
- Anchor program: 5 instruction stubs (initialize, create_alarm, claim, snooze, slash)
- Android app: Kotlin/Compose stub with Hilt DI
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow

## Risks / Blockers
- GitHub auth needed for push to private repo
- Full build verification requires Android SDK and Anchor CLI installed
